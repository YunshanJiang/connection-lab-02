The project i want to make is a calendar website. 
Intentions:
My idea is user can customize their own calendar which allow users to add reminder, videos, images and etc. The website give users a space of creation and 
it is different from social media website that datas are shared to every users. The website creates a private space for users.


function:
The functions of the website have sending daliy quote to user and showing user edited information. Users are able to switch different days and present
different daily information.

Challenges:
i have very little knowledge about data space so it would be a chalenge for me to make function like creativing account for users, sending, saving and pulling
data from users.
